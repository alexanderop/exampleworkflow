# AFK Workflow

An [**AFK coding pipeline**](https://alexanderop.github.io/) built on top of
[`defineworkflow`](https://github.com/alexanderop/defineworkflow) — the
deterministic, crash-safe multi-agent workflow engine.

> **HITL at the edges, AFK in the middle.** You align on the spec and review the
> PR. Everything between — slice, implement, refactor, QA — runs without you.

## The pipeline

The article's six phases. Phases 1 and 6 are yours; the four in the middle are
this workflow (`workflows/afk-pipeline.workflow.ts`):

```
1. Align on spec        ── HITL ──  you + business + an AI interviewer
2. Slice the ticket     ── AFK  ──  PRD → vertical, shippable slices
3. Ralph loop per slice ── AFK  ──  fresh-context agent, TDD red-green-refactor
4. Refactor pass        ── AFK  ──  the /simplify step LLMs always skip
5. Agentic QA           ── AFK  ──  agent-browser drives the real UI
6. Review               ── HITL ──  you review the diff, business does UAT
```

Each AFK phase maps to a primitive:

| Phase | Primitive | What runs |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Slice | `agent({ schema })` | one slicer agent → validated `slices[]` |
| Ralph loop | `parallel()` + per-slice loop | one fresh-context TDD agent per iteration, per slice |
| Refactor | `agent()` | a single `/simplify` pass over the merged branch |
| QA | `agent({ schema })` | an `agent-browser` QA agent → validated report |

The Ralph loop calls `agent()` once per iteration — **a fresh context every
time**, mirroring `while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude; done` — and stops when the
agent reports `remaining: 0`, exactly like Ralph's `grep -q "^- \[ \]" || break`.

## Setup

Requires Node ≥20 and pnpm. Already installed here; from scratch:

```bash
pnpm install
```

`defineworkflow` runs against the `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, or `raw-api`
harness — set by the `harness` field in each workflow file. Check what's on your
PATH:

```bash
pnpm adapters
```

## Run it

**Dry-run (no agents, no tokens)** — iterate on control flow, phases, and the UI:

```bash
pnpm afk:mock --args '{"prd":"docs/prd-booking-wizard.md"}'
```

**For real** (spawns agents, spends tokens):

```bash
pnpm afk --args '{"prd":"docs/prd-booking-wizard.md","appUrl":"http://localhost:3000/book"}'
```

`--args` accepts:

| key | default | meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `prd` | `docs/prd-booking-wizard.md` | path to your PRD (write it in Phase 1) |
| `appUrl` | `http://localhost:3000` | URL the QA agent drives in Phase 5 |

Smoke-test the engine first if you like:

```bash
pnpm haiku:mock
```

## Your two jobs (the HITL edges)

**Phase 1 — write the spec.** The pipeline is only as good as the PRD it reads.
`docs/prd-booking-wizard.md` is a sample; replace it. Interview-mode helps:

```
i want to build <X>. interview me one question at a time until you can write
a PRD. cover goals, user, happy path, edge cases, validation, error states,
and out-of-scope. write it to docs/prd-<x>.md when done.
```

**Phase 6 — review.** Read the diff and the test names. Run it locally. Send the
preview URL to whoever co-wrote the PRD for UAT. An agent can't be held
accountable — you ship it.

## Layout

```
workflows/
  afk-pipeline.workflow.ts   the six-phase pipeline (AFK middle)
  haiku.workflow.ts          minimal smoke test
docs/
  prd-booking-wizard.md      sample PRD — replace with your own
scripts/
  ralph.sh                   standalone bash Ralph driver (worktree-per-ticket)
```

## Engine gotchas (baked into the workflows here)

`defineworkflow` runs workflow bodies in a deterministic VM sandbox. Two rules
the files in `workflows/` already follow:

- **`import { z } from "defineworkflow"`**, not from `"zod"`. The sandbox strips
  the `defineworkflow` import and injects the engine's own `z`; a raw `zod`
  import can't be resolved and fails to transform.
- **The default-exported `defineWorkflow(...)` must be the first statement.** All
  schemas and helpers live *inside* `run()`. (Also: don't put the literal text
  `export default defineWorkflow(` in a comment — the transform replaces the
  first match.)
- **No `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, or argless `new Date()`** in a workflow
  body — they'd break journal replay. Pass timestamps via `--args`.

## How durability works

Every `agent()` result is appended to a per-run journal keyed by sequence
number. If a run crashes or you stop it, resume replays the journal and only
re-invokes the model for steps that never completed:

```bash
pnpm list                 # defineworkflow list — run ids + status
pnpm exec defineworkflow resume <id>
```
